What actually I done!

I am tried to build a Automated Script using python. 
When script run it can automatically fetch the trending #hashtag for particular region.
Show the trending #hashtag with number of tweets.
Script can able to download .csv file for particular Trend with number of attributes like (username,description,Followers,Follwing,retweetcount,text,#hashtags)
After fetching the tweets script can apply sentiment analysis.
Sentiment analysis a part of natural language processing.
Determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.
